# Diamonds-competition

A diamonds dataset and we were encourage to make prediction using Machine Learning Techniques about prices. Here you can find a summary of my results. Link kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diamonds-datamad0620/overviewâ€‹

- First, we clean the dataset in order to understand the data .

- Then, we test different regression ML algorithms to see which one shows a higher R2 and RMSE.

- Finally, we choose the two models with the highest score and we perform a hyperparameter optimization with GridSearchCV to increase the accuracy of the prediction.
